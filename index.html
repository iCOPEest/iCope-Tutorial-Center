<section id="about" style="display: none;">
    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Welcome to iCOPE! Our journey began with a simple dream. I was once a teacher who started with little more than passion and determination. Teaching is never easy, it demands patience, dedication, and a genuine interest in helping others. You can't please everyone, but over time, I became one of the most awarded teachers in my field.</p>
    <p>There were times when I doubted myself, when I questioned whether I was good enough or if teaching was the right profession for me. I considered leaving it all behind and returning to my original career as a customer service representative. And for a while, I did step away. But the calling to teach was always there, reminding me of the impact I could have.</p>
    <p>One day, I decided to return to teaching, with the help and encouragement of my sister. I joined a company as a teacher and, to my surprise, I was able to attract students from all levels, beginners to advanced learners. Through hard work and dedication, one of my students, who later became a close friend, suggested that I open my own center. At first, I thought it was impossible. But as more people encouraged me, the idea began to feel real.</p>
    <p>Eventually, I took the leap and decided to become a freelance teacher, and in time, I realized the dream of opening this center. Today, we are a thriving company, and it's thanks to the many students who trusted me and stayed with me throughout my journey. Their support, kind words, and valuable feedback have been the driving force behind our success.</p>
    <p>At iCOPE, we are committed to helping people from all walks of life, regardless of age, nationality, or background, pursue their learning goals. Our passion for teaching remains as strong as when I first started, and we are here to continue sharing that passion with the world.</p>
    <P>Everyone has the right and freedom to learn, and it is our privilege to support that journey.</P>
    <p>Join us as we delve into tailored learning experiences designed to help you achieve your ultimate potential!</p>
